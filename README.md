## Description

Built an application that determines a user's age based on a planet’s solar years.

### Website should have:

Features that take a person’s age in years and create a class that does the following:

- Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
- Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
- Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
- Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
- Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet.
- Returns the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy, if a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy.
